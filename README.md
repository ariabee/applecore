(aka "voice-controlled-world-game")

Language, Action, & Perception Software Project

Winter 2020-2021

## random program-running notes
- To run learn-actions.py (a test of possibilities so far): `python3 learn-actions.py`


- So far, need to install [speech_recognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) Python module in order to run game. (Subject to change upon adding our own speech-to-text API.)
